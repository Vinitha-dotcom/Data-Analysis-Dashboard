# From ovens to orders: A pizza Sales Report
## Project Objective
pizza sales report for 2023

## KPI'S Requirement
We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:
1 . Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.

total revenue by the total number of orders.

3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.

4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.

5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

## Charts Requirement

We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

Conclusion
In concluding my  project, "From Ovens to Orders: A Pizza Sales Report," I have effectively utilized Power BI to dissect and understand the intricacies of pizza sales throughout 2023. The rigorous data collection and sophisticated analysis have uncovered key insights into consumer behaviors, sales patterns, and the operational efficacy of pizza selling businesses. By examining aspects such as daily and monthly order trends, preferred toppings, and pizza sizes, we have equipped industry stakeholders with the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions. My  findings underscore the critical role of data analytics in identifying customer preferences and streamlining business operations. The project not only demonstrates our ability to harness technology for strategic advantage but also enhances our understanding of the competitive landscape in the food industry. The actionable intelligence derived from our analysis provides a solid groundwork for pizza vendors aiming to refine their offerings and operational strategies in response to evolving market demands.

As we move forward, the insights and methodologies established through this project will serve as invaluable assets. They will not only guide future endeavors aimed at enhancing customer satisfaction and business performance but also contribute to the broader narrative of innovation and adaptation in the face of changing consumer landscapes.
